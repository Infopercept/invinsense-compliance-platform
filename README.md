<h1>Integration of Virtual CISO services and an Intuitive Platform</h1>
 
### Invinsense GSOS
Cybersecurity is now a boardroom topic and needs the attention of all the stakeholders. Adversaries are more organized than ever in launching sophisticated attacks leveraging legitimate tools and weak points to gain entry, analyze the network and ecosystem, move laterally, and achieve their objective in the form of a full-blown breach.
The only way organizations can beat adversaries in their own game is to plan, prepare and execute like them. The response action plan against the adversaries needs strategy and execution that are proactive and actionable. 
Such a response plan is possible only if organizations have security leadership and a platform that gives actionable insight to the leadership. A security leader, popularly known as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for security strategy and execution to protect organizations from existing and potential threats, from known and unknown sources. A CISO, with the help of technology, people and processes, works towards reducing risks to the business.
However, there are many organizations that don’t have a security leadership role and there are many organizations that have CISO who is too occupied and stretched in day-to-day cybersecurity operations. 
Invinsense GSOS is a unique combination of virtual CISO services and an Intuitive platform that helps organizations to prepare security posture, strategy and execution through leadership and actionable intelligence from the platform.
